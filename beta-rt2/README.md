## [Project 1 : Robotics Inference - version 1](./P1V1-Inference)
###### GOALS
- Learn how to use Nvidia Digits tool to manage data
- Learn to evaluate real-time considerations when using
an inference engine in robotics applications
- Design an robotics system using inference, collect
dataset for classification, and justify network design
choices based on analysis

## [Project 2 : Where Am I - version 1](./P2V1-Localization)
###### GOALS
- Develop my own package in ROS from scratch
- Build a custom robot model in a simulation environment - Gazebo and RViz, in ROS; a differential drive robot
 with a camera and a lidar sensor.
- Use the Adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization or AMCL package to localize the robot inside
the map.
- Tune some parameters for my robot to achieve the robotâ€™s
desired position and orientation and achieve decent results
